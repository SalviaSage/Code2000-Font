# Code2000-Font

This is the recommended font for the Translingual Phonetic Alphabet.\
A unicode based phonetic alphabet that was created by me.\
\
I am not the author of these fonts and I take no credit for them.\
I am hosting them here as I believe the websites where they were hosted are now offline.
